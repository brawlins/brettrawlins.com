Recently I completed a [CSS Animation course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-animation-14153685) on LinkedIn Learning. I've done plenty of CSS before, but had never really played around with animations. I was surprised at some of the cool things you can do with just CSS! After learning some of the basics, I decided to play around some more and see what I could create. Here are a couple of code pens just for fun:

- [CSS Blowing Leaves](https://codepen.io/brawlins/full/QWXavRR)
- [CSS Night Sky Time-Lapse](https://codepen.io/brawlins/full/VwJyGJv)
