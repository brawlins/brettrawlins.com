Lately I've been exploring different AI tools to help with coding tasks. It's been very interesting. It's kind of like pair programming with an AI assistant. You can ask it questions, have it refactor your code, or even generate new code for you.

I've tried Copilot, ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude. Some produce better results than others, but overall I think they can be quite helpful and can increase your productivity.

As an exercise I decided to try coding a few small projects with the help of AI. I was able to build things in a matter of hours that would have taken much longer on my own. Here are a few examples:
