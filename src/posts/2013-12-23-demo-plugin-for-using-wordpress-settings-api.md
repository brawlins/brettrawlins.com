I spent a lot of time recently figuring out the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API" target="_blank">Wordpress Settings API</a>. Although there are still parts of it that remain shrouded in mystery, I think I've got a decent handle on it now.

I decided to create a demo plugin that I could use as a reference for future plugin development. This plugin creates a settings page that allows you to organize your settings fields into sections and tabs. It's a bit long to post here, but you can <a href="https://github.com/brawlins/my-settings-tabs" target="_blank">check it out on github</a>.

When I have time, maybe I'll write a post with more explanation of how it works and what I learned along the way.
