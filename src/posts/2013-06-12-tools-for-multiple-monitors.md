I love small focused apps that do one thing, and do it well. Here are a few that I discovered recently that come in handy when working on multiple monitors.

## CatchMouse

Ever lose track of your mouse when working on multiple monitors? That happens to me a lot. <a href="http://ftnew.com/catchmouse.html" target="_blank">CatchMouse</a> is a free app that solves that problem very simply, but effectively. With a user-defined keyboard shortcut, it centers your mouse in the screen and zooms it. You can set up a separate shortcut for each monitor, which not only helps you locate your mouse, but moves it to the screen where you're working. Bonus!

## SizeUp

It helps to have a utility for moving and resizing windows, especially when working with multiple monitors. I was using <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/" target="_blank">Cinch</a> to resize my windows, until I discovered it had a more powerful big brother. <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/" target="_blank">SizeUp</a> lets you resize windows, *and* move them between monitors, all from the keyboard, using customizable keyboard shortcuts.

## MenuPop

There are several utilities that copy the menu bar to each screen, but I didn't love any of them. <a href="http://www.binarybakery.com/product.php?app=menupop" target="_blank">MenuPop</a> takes a more minimalist approach, giving you a context-menu popup of the menu bar items, activated with a user-defined keyboard shortcut.
