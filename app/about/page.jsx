          I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer. I love building new things
          and learning about web technologies. This is where I write about
          things I learn. The more I learn, the more I realize how much I
          don&apos;t know. This blog is primarily an archive of learning that I
          keep as a reference for myself, but hopefully it will prove useful to
          someone else too.
